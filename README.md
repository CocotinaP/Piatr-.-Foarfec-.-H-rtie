I tried to recreate the classic game "Rock. Scissors. Paper" in a web page using html, css and javaScript. 
This version gives players the opportunity to choose one of three game options and they will fight with the computer's random choice. 
Of course, the result and score are displayed. And, in addition, the player can choose to reset the score.
